**Abstract:**
We define a coalgebra structure for open strings transverse to any framed
codimension 2 submanifold $$K \subset M$$. When the submanifold is a knot in
$$\mathbb{R}^3$$; we show this structure recovers a specialization of Ng cord
algebra, a non-trivial knot invariant which is not determined by a number of
other knot invariants.
